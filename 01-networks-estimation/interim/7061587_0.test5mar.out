Iteration 1 of at most 60:
Model statistics ‘nodefactor.deg.casl.1’ are not varying. This may indicate that the observed data occupies an extreme point in the sample space or that the estimation has reached a dead-end configuration.
Warning: Model statistics ‘nodematch.race’ are linear combinations of some set of preceding statistics at the current stage of the estimation. This may indicate that the model is nonidentifiable.
Warning: ‘glpk’ selected as the solver, but package ‘Rglpk’ is not available; falling back to ‘lpSolveAPI’. This should be fine unless the sample size and/or the number of parameters is very big.

Error in ergm.MCMLE(init, nw, model, initialfit = (initialfit <- NULL),  : 
  Number of edges in a simulated network exceeds that in the observed by a factor of more than 20. This is a strong indicator of model degeneracy or a very poor starting parameter configuration. If you are reasonably certain that neither of these is the case, increase the MCMLE.density.guard control.ergm() parameter.
