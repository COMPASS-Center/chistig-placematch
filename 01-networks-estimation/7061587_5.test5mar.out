Model statistics ‘nodematch.age.grp.1’, ‘concurrent’, and ‘nodefactor.race.3’ are not varying. This may indicate that the observed data occupies an extreme point in the sample space or that the estimation has reached a dead-end configuration.
Warning: Model statistics ‘nodefactor.race.2’ are linear combinations of some set of preceding statistics at the current stage of the estimation. This may indicate that the model is nonidentifiable.

  Number of edges in a simulated network exceeds that in the observed by a factor of more than 20. This is a strong indicator of model degeneracy or a very poor starting parameter configuration.
