Model statistics ‘nodefactor.deg.tot.3+’ are not varying. This may indicate that the observed data occupies an extreme point in the sample space or that the estimation has reached a dead-end configuration.

Error in ergm.MCMLE(init, nw, model, initialfit = (initialfit <- NULL),  : 
  Number of edges in a simulated network exceeds that in the observed by a factor of more than 20. This is a strong indicator of model degeneracy or a very poor starting parameter configuration. If you are reasonably certain that neither of these is the case, increase the MCMLE.density.guard control.ergm() parameter.
